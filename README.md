# active-directory-inactive-user-script
A small script I wrote for the Server admins at Avita Health systems that finds inactive users on AD.
I was given the task to find users that were not active for 180 days with the user account number of 512. This was my first time writing powershell 
and the syntax is not my favorite.
However, it was a interesting and rewarding task.
